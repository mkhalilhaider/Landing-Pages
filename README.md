# Landing Pages Repository

Welcome to my **Landing Pages** repository!

## What This Repo Is About

Hi there! This repository is where I’m sharing the landing pages I create as part of my learning journey. Each landing page is organized into its own folder, and if there are any images or other assets needed, they’ll be stored in a dedicated `assets` folder within that landing page’s folder.

I’ll be adding new landing pages over time, so check back periodically for updates!

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Landing-Pages/`
  - `landing-page-<n>/` (Where `<n>` is the page number)
    - `assets/` (Images and other assets for this landing page)

As I continue to work on new landing pages, they’ll be added here with a similar structure. This helps me stay organized and makes it easy to see my progress over time.
